# TinyApp

## About the Project
Full stack web application built with Node and Express.

### Problem Statement

Given a long URL, provide a new URL hosted through the server that is shorter than the original.

### Expected Usage

This program should be used in the browser by pasting the long URL when prompted. This will return a shorter URL. All past URLs are stored in the server, and can be edited or deleted.

## Getting Started
Install all dependencies (using the 'npm install' command). Run the development web server using the 'node express_server.js' command.
